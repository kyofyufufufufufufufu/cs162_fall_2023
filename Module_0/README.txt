Five topics that I’m interested in in relation to computers:
Simulation – I love the idea of making simulations like trains or flying simulations for pilots. It’s one of my main focuses when it comes to my Computer Science major.
Digital forensics – I’m really interested in the idea of using technology in the legal sphere. Pre-law was one of my original choices for a major, but I chose CS because I like it just a little bit more. CS 477 is offered at OSU that covers this topic well and I intend on taking it.
Technical Issues – It could be considered a broad topic, but I have no problem with technical, straight-to-the point issues. For me, they’re easy to solve. With coding/programming, a lot of what I’ve dealt with were technical issues and I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect to it. Figuring out what made my code work or didn’t work was a lot of fun.
Graphic Interface – You mentioned it in class as something difficult that we’ll be learning in week 4 or 5, but I’m excited to learn how to develop those skills. I have no doubt that it will take time to understand and wrap my head around, but the topic interests me a lot.
Data Structures – I’m really looking forward to this class and plan on taking it next term!

Five topics that I think will be challenging:

Conceptualization/Theory - It’s one of the hardest things for me and I understand that there can be a lot of conceptualizing involved when it comes to coding/programming/computers. Not only in CS, but math classes too. Word problems are hard for me to understand. Still, I make the best of it and work hard at it.
 New Languages – As mentioned in class, a new language seems intimidating and frustrating. I’m currently enrolled in CS 162 and CS 133C so I know it might be difficult.
Recursion – We barely covered this in my CS 161 and the topic didn’t stick. I hope I’ll be able to understand at the end of this class.
Polymorphism and Inheritance – Classes confused me, but I really struggled with inheritance.
Programmer Imposter Syndrome – I feel like, at times, that I’m not very good at programming/coding/CS. I’ve received good grades for my work, but at the same time I’m worried that I’m not cut out for it. I’ll try my best to be confident and work on my skills to be as good as I can be, though.
